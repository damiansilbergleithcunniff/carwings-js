-   This project is based on the boilerplate available here: <https://github.com/diegohaz/nod>
-   Joe Shaw's project was the first that I encountered with a carwings implementaion: <https://github.com/joeshaw/carwings>
-   Josh Perry's project was the first JS implemenation I saw but it was out of date and appeared unmaintained: <https://github.com/joshperry/carwings>
-   Phil Cole's implemenation in python3 provides the basis for this project.  It was easy to read, well documented, and most importantly, it had an open PR for the latest update (July 2019) of the carwings API.  <https://github.com/filcole/pycarwings2>
